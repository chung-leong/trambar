Trambar
-------

Trambar is a companion tool for GitLab. It lets you transform your GitLab activity log into a Facebook-style news feed, making the information more accessible to those without a programming background. It provides greater transparency to your software development process, with the aim of fostering trust between programmers and other stakeholders.

Trambar is designed to work with self-hosted instances of GitLab. It's not possible currently to pair it with an account at [gitlab.com](https://about.gitlab.com/).
