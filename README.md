Trambar
-------

Trambar is a companion tool to GitLab. It lets you transform your GitLab
activity log into a Facebook-style news feed, making the information more
accessible to those without a programming background. It provides greater
transparency to your software development process, with the aim of fostering
trust between programmers and other stakeholders.

Trambar is designed to facilitate casual, informal discussions. Metaphorically,
it's like a bar that people go to after work. People would inevitably end up
talking about work, but it doesn't feel like work. By providing a certain
measure of "fun", Trambar lets you raise the level of awareness among team
members without raising the stress level.
