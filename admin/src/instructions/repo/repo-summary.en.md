**Name** - If a name is provided, it will be used in place of the repository's
name in GitLab. It allows you to show a friendlier, less technical name to
users, if the repo happens to have a really clunky name. It is also useful
when you anticipate users who speak a different language.

**GitLab project name** - The name of the repository as it is known in Gitlab.

**Issue tracker** - When issue tracking is enabled, users with a GitLab
account can add posts (his own or other people's) to the repository's issue
tracker. In GitLab, this option is in a project's *Settings* page, under
*Permissions*.
