**URL** - The data source's URL.

**Identifier** - The data source's unique identifier.

**Type** - The software providing the REST API.

**Max age** - The amount of time (in seconds) data can sit in the server cache before a freshness check is made. A shorter interval means new data will appear more quickly but places greater load on the data source. A long interval can be used if WordPress is configured to send cache purge requests.
