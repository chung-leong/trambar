**Server type** - GitHub

**Name** - There is no need to change this.

**Identifier** - There is no need to change this.

**New users** - Controls whether new Trambar accounts are created for users
authenticated through GitHub. You can choose to make GitHub users guests at
your site or make them regular users.

If you choose to not register new users, then only users you've manually created
can sign-in through GitHub. You will need to know which e-mail address they've
used to sign up for GitHub.

**Role assignment** - You can automatically assign roles to new users
authenticated through this server. This is useful for story filtering.

**Callback URL** - You will need this URL when you create an OAuth app in the
[GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/developers/) page. First,
press the *New OAuth App* button. Enter an application name (e.g. _Rick's
Trambar_), then the site's URL, followed by this URL in the box labeled
*Authorization callback URL*. Press the *Register Application* button.

**Client ID** - Copy the client ID from GitHub Developer Settings.

**Client secret** - Copy the client secret from GitHub Developer Settings.

For the app icon, you may use your company's logo or choose Trambar's
[default icon](github-icons.zip). The backgrond color for the latter is #f29d25.
