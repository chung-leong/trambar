It should be concise--one or two words.

of Trambar. It is not currently used.

from this page.

**Story priority** - Story priority determines which stories appear in the News
Feed when there is an overabundance of them. You may choose to increase the
likelihood that people will see stories by those with important roles in the
project. Conversely, you may choose to discard stories of those who play a
more tangential role.

The story will mostly impact users who visit the site infrequently. Users who
use the tool on a daily basis will end up seeing all stories.
